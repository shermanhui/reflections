How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Saving different versions allows you to rollback to previously working versions if you encounter bugs. It allows for documentation of the changes you've made as your project progesses. We can access histories offline as well.

As a programmer when would you want versions of your program saved?

At regular intervals? Big enough changes? Long pause in editing? When you choose to save a version?
